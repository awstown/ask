A Facebook status analysis experiment

## Disclaimer
This code is only a proof-of-concept and in no way claims to predict suicide.
Any results produced by this should *NOT* be considered indicative of depression or suicidal thinking. 

## Inspiration
This is a suicide prevention app and was inspired by the Durkheim Project(DP)
(http://www.durkheimproject.org/) . DP performed a sentiment analysis of
clinical notes from a set of veterans who were victims of suicide. From the analysis a set of words and phrases that correlated with suicide was produced. DP developed an app that monitored a consenting veteran patient's social media activity
for signs of suicidal thinking. When suicidal thinking was detected the patients clinician was automatically notified and could hopefully intervene.

## This app is about taking care of your own
The above is great except it relied on patient cooperation and for
clinicians to be responsive. When some are having suicidal thoughts they will mention suicide. It's often subtle and can be easily dismissed. This is where we hear stories of loved ones not realizing the cries for help until afterwards. One of best ways to prevent suicide is to open the door for someone in need to talk about it.

We share so much of ourselves online through social media these days it's only 
natural that one might express their thoughts of suicide online. In our busy social media lives it's easy to miss the signs between the dancing cats. This app aims to empower caring individuals by highlighting the the warning signs that often precede
a suicide. A user would install the app on Facebook and it would analyze the user's friends statuses for signs of suicidal thoughts and notify the user. At this time, it would also provide resources on how to reach out and have the courage to connect with the friend they are concerned about. So many suicides could be prevented if more people just **asked**... so **ask**.

## Future (or not)
Unfortunately, I will probably not be continuing this project as Samaritans Radar (below) has already launched and has gained some notoriety. 

I was hoping to get into:
  * Add a true suicidal phrase data set
  * Semantic Analysis (instead of the essentially just word search the app is performing now)
  * Better Facebook integration
  * Learning and tracking over time, to detect strong mood changes

## Samaritains Rader
Samaritans Radar(SR) (http://www.samaritansradar.org/) has developed an app based on the "community" model above. Unfortunately, they received some backlash based on security and privacy concerns. Because of this they have temporarily suspended their app. They are currently taking feedback to help address these concerns and working more closely with the mental health community. They're taking their time to do it right before relaunch.
